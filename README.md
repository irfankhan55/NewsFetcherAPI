```bash
mkdir certs

openssl genrsa -out certs/devcert.key 2048

openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key certs/devcert.key -sha256 -days 365 \
-out certs/devcert.crt -subj "/CN=localhost"

openssl pkcs12 -export -out certs/devcert.pfx -inkey certs/devcert.key -in certs/devcert.crt -password pass:1234

sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain certs/devcert.crt

```
Enter your password if prompted.

You will now see three files under the certs folder.
